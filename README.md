# bruteforcemovable (seedhelper rewrite in PHP)

This is the code for https://bruteforcemovable.com, it is a rewrite of seedhelper using PHP. 

The code in this repository is not 1:1 the version that is currently running as im currently in a middle of a big refactor. 

To use this you will need to install composer on the host and run "composer install" on the directory - composer will then automatically install all needed dependencies.
